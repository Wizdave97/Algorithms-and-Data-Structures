TASK 3:
(080) is the area code for fixed line telephones in Bangalore.
Fixed line numbers include parentheses, so Bangalore numbers
have the form (080)xxxxxxx.)

Part A: Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people
in Bangalore.
 - Fixed lines start with an area code enclosed in brackets. The area
   codes vary in length but always begin with 0.
 - Mobile numbers have no parentheses, but have a space in the middle
   of the number to help readability. The prefix of a mobile number
   is its first four digits, and they always start with 7, 8 or 9.
 - Telemarketers' numbers have no parentheses or space, but they start
   with the area code 140.

Print the answer as part of a message:
"The numbers called by people in Bangalore have codes:"
 <list of codes>
The list of codes should be print out one per line in lexicographic order with no duplicates.

Part B: What percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are made
to fixed lines also in Bangalore? In other words, of all the calls made
from a number starting with "(080)", what percentage of these calls
were made to a number also starting with "(080)"?

Print the answer as a part of a message::
"<percentage> percent of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are calls
to other fixed lines in Bangalore."
The percentage should have 2 decimal digits

calculating the time complexity for the extract_bangalore_calls algorithm:
It has a single for loop that runs for n in the worst case
Assume in the worst case all conditionals are checked
f(n)=2 + 20(n)
O(f(n))=20n + 2
approximately O(n)

Time complexity for part_a
 there are two for loops and since they are not nested on the worst case
 they in the range of n which is the input size
 assume in the worst case, the size of the dictionary and the set are equal with combined size n
 f(n)=n+ 4 + 2*n
     =3n + 5
O(f(n))=3n + 5
O(f(n)) can be approximated to O(n)
